# Comics and ImageText

## LIT 6216

## Dr. Anastasia Salter

## Course Description

In this seminar, we will explore the contemporary comic, considering literary and cultural works across a range of platforms and markets. Comics are still frequently (and historically) associated with popular culture, and linked to children's literature and mass media, even as they loom large through big and small screen adaptations with global reach. However, the combination of image and text has a powerful role in literary practice. As we survey works by influential artists and authors including Ta-Nehisi Coates, Gilbert Hernandez, Jason, Nnedi Okorafor, Noelle Stevenson, and Gene Luen Yang, we will consider the influence of changing technologies and distribution mechanisms on our understanding of "comics" and imagetext more broadly. Forms under examination include:

- Newspaper one-panel and "daily" strips
- Experimental graphic novels
- Comic as memoir / Autobiographical comics
- Literary influences on mainstream superhero comics
- Representation and cultural reception of comics
- Experimental webcomics and zines
- Motion comics and interactive work

Assignments include weekly discussions with shared close readings; comic annotation; and an iterative conference-length research paper.

## Course Objectives

- Develop an understanding of comics as a form, including the terminology and theoretical frameworks necessary to discuss image-texts broadly
- Explore the influence of comics on culture through both popular icons and independent, literary works
- Analyze comics and graphic novels through an intersectional lens, situating them as a site of cultural conflict and identity discourse
- Situate arguments in the history of comic studies, and draw parallels to other literary forms and theories
- Critique emerging and experimental works in the context of changing platforms and technologies impacting creation, distribution, and reception of image-text

## Materials and Texts

While students are welcome to purchase the individual books, all primary texts will be available through [Comixology Unlimited](https://www.comixology.com/unlimited), a service with a free one-month trial ($6 monthly after) that is significantly cheaper than the purchase price of the course texts. Secondary texts will be available as PDFs or on library e-reserve (marked with an asterisk).

## General Policies

### Academic Integrity

[The Center for Academic Integrity (CAI)](http://academicintegrity.org/) defines academic integrity as a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals into action.

**UCF Creed:** Integrity, scholarship, community, creativity, and excellence are the core values that guide our conduct, performance, and decisions.

1. Integrity: I will practice and defend academic and personal honesty.
2. Scholarship: I will cherish and honor learning as a fundamental purpose of my membership in the UCF community.
3. Community: I will promote an open and supportive campus environment by respecting the rights and contributions of every individual.
4. Creativity: I will use my talents to enrich the human experience.
5. Excellence: I will strive toward the highest standards of performance in any endeavor I undertake.

Students should familiarize themselves with [UCF’s Rules of Conduct](https://scai.sdes.ucf.edu/student-rules-of-conduct/). According to Section 1, “Academic Misconduct,” students are prohibited from engaging in

1. Unauthorized assistance: Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information or study aids in any academic exercise unless specifically authorized by the instructor of record. The unauthorized possession of examination or course-related material also constitutes cheating.
2. Communication to another through written, visual, electronic, or oral means: The presentation of material which has not been studied or learned, but rather was obtained through someone else’s efforts and used as part of an examination, course assignment, or project.
3. Commercial Use of Academic Material: Selling of course material to another person, student, and/or uploading course material to a third-party vendor without authorization or without the express written permission of the university and the instructor. Course materials include but are not limited to class notes, Instructor’s PowerPoints, course syllabi, tests, quizzes, labs, instruction sheets, homework, study guides, handouts, etc.
4. Falsifying or misrepresenting the student’s own academic work.
5. Plagiarism: Using or appropriating another’s work without any indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the impression that such work is the student’s own.
6. Multiple Submissions: Submitting the same academic work for credit more than once without the express written permission of the instructor.
7. Helping another violate academic behavior standards.
8. Soliciting assistance with academic coursework and/or degree requirements.

### Responses to Academic Dishonesty, Plagiarism, or Cheating

Students should also familiarize themselves with the procedures for academic misconduct in UCF’s student handbook, [The Golden Rule](https://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/). UCF faculty members have a responsibility for students’ education and the value of a UCF degree, and so seek to prevent unethical behavior and respond to academic misconduct when necessary. Penalties for violating rules, policies, and instructions within this course can range from a zero on the exercise to an “F” letter grade in the course. In addition, an Academic Misconduct report could be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which could lead to disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, or deferred suspension or separation from the University through suspension, dismissal, or expulsion with the addition of a “Z” designation on one’s transcript.

### Course Accessibility Statement

The University of Central Florida is committed to providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities. Students with disabilities who need access to course content due to course design limitations should contact the professor as soon as possible. Students should also connect with [Student Accessibility Services (SAS)](http://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/) (Ferrell Commons 185, sas@ucf.edu, phone 407-823-2371). For students connected with SAS, a Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Determining reasonable access and accommodations requires consideration of the course design, course learning objectives and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SAS, faculty and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.

### Campus Safety Statement

In the event you are working from or near campus, please note the following policies with regards to campus safety:

- To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to <https://my.ucf.edu> and logging in. Click on “Student Self Service” located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue “Personal Information” heading on the Student Center screen, click on “UCF Alert”, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click “Apply” to save the changes, and then click “OK.”
- Students with special needs related to emergency situations should speak with their instructors outside of class.

### Deployed Active Duty Military Students

Students who are deployed active duty military and/or National Guard personnel and require accommodation should contact their instructors as soon as possible after the semester begins and/or after they receive notification of deployment to make related arrangements.

### Authorized Events and Religious Observances

Students who represent the university in an authorized event or activity (for example, student-athletes) and who are unable to meet a course deadline due to a conflict with that event must provide the instructor with documentation in advance to arrange a make-up. No penalty will be applied.

Students must notify their instructor in advance if they intend to miss class for a religious observance. For more information, see the [UCF policy](http://regulations.ucf.edu/chapter5/documents/5.020ReligiousObservancesFINALJan19.pdf).

## COVID-19 Statements and Policies

To protect members of our community, everyone is required to wear a facial covering inside all common spaces including [classrooms](https://policies.ucf.edu/documents/PolicyEmergencyCOVIDReturnPolicy.pdf). Students who choose not to wear facial coverings will be asked to leave the classroom by the instructor. If they refuse to leave the classroom or put on a facial covering, they may be considered disruptive (please see the Golden Rule for student behavior expectations). Faculty have the right to cancel class if the safety and well-being of class members are in jeopardy. Students will be responsible for the material that would have been covered in class as provided by the instructor.  
Depending on the course of the pandemic during the semester, the university may make changes to the way classes are offered. If that happens, please look for announcements or messages in Webcourses@UCF or Knights email about changes specific to this course.

**COVID-19 and Illness Notification** – Students who believe they may have a COVID-19 diagnosis should contact UCF Student Health Services (407-823-2509) so proper contact tracing procedures can take place.
Students should not come to campus if they are ill, are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19, have tested positive for COVID, or if anyone living in their residence has tested positive or is sick with COVID-19 symptoms. CDC guidance for COVID-19 symptoms is [located here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)

Students should contact their instructor(s) as soon as possible if they miss class for any illness reason to discuss reasonable adjustments that might need to be made. When possible, students should contact their instructor(s) before missing class.

**In Case of Faculty Illness** – If the instructor falls ill during the semester, there may be changes to this course, including having a backup instructor take over the course. Please look for announcements or mail in Webcourses@UCF or Knights email for any alterations to this course.
